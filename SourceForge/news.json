  "text": "I still don't have SMLPack. Someone please get me one for Delphi 2006.\r\nAnyways, the changelog is getting longer:\r\n - Bundling: .beats is not included anymore\r\n ! Logging: logs those things only that really happened\r\n ! Accessibility: The windows is visible when it should be and is minimized when it should be (hopefully; fourth try)\r\n ! Countdown: The SysTray icon shows remaining time normally\r\n ! Shutdown: Hibernation works normally (thanks goes to Arne (pi82) for finding the bug)\r\n * Source: Ported to Delphi 2006 -&gt; uses Indy 10, JVCL, doesn't use RXLib anymore. 'Sky' is no longer available\r\n * Shutdown: Shutdown for Sure enhanced\r\n * Accessibility: Parameters can have a '-', '/' or '--' prefix\r\n + Logging: Verbose logging added. Launch Shutdown Monster with the parameter 'v' to use it\r\n + CPU usage: 'Shutdown only if there is no data input' should work now (but it is off by default, for stability and security purposes)\r\n",

  "text": "I'd like to thank all of you for the great reviews and for over 100,000 downloads. That's huge. I never thought this little piece of software would reach something that amazing.\r\nAnd this is also why I feel quite ashamed - I stopped working on this project almost 4 years ago. I'm really sorry for this -- I didn't have the time and effort to continue working on it. Later on I've put a lot of thought into this, I wanted to continue developing it, then I wanted to start over the whole thing in C++, but I just didn't do anything. And now, in 2010, downloading a shutdown utility is no longer needed, as current versions of Windows have quite advanced energy saving policies, and the system can do most of the things people usually need.\r\nThere is still some need for advanced functions, but I think it's negligible. The built-in functions are sufficient for most of us, including me.\r\nMaybe, if I'll have some free time, I'll reconsider the demand for Shutdown Monster, and maybe I'll &quot;resurrect&quot; it -- but this is quite unlikely.\r\nI'm really sorry, I feel bad for killing off &quot;The Monster&quot;. Thank you very much for your support, it really meant a lot to me.\r\nLove,\r\nDavid.",
