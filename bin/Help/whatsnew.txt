Released [08/30/2005]
 ! Missing translations fixed
 ! Everything uses Settings.ini; Shutdown.ini isn't created anymore

 + Check for updates automagically

Released [08/27/2005]

Version Ocean - 4.0		Official		More precise timing
Released [08/01/2005]

 ! The SysTray icon's hint displays the remaining time correctly (hours, minutes or seconds), this time not only for the first second :P
 ! 'Check for Updates' (C4U) and 'Synchronize time' functions work in low priority --> won't make the program freeze down
 * "Shutdown for Sure" changed (checking 36 times in 180 seconds (5 seconds intervals) became checking once, after 2 minutes :]). The 'second try' is forced in any case, ensuring that your PC will really shut down
 * Timing (Countdown, CPU usage) works in high priority --> they're more precise
